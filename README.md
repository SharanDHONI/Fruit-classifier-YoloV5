# Fruit-classifier-YoloV5
A simple fruit classifier, trained with yoloV5s.pt.
The training was only for 15 epochs and with a total of 1500 images for training. 
Also Note that the training images were not natural. Most of the images used for training were images of the fruit with no background Noise.
Therefore, Can't expect the model to perform too well with real world data with too much noice. 
(although, we can train it for more iterations and with more real world images)
